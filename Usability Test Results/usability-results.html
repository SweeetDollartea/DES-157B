            Based on the testing results, I was able to observe how I needed to still focus on engaging with the user in a unique way.
            Some of the things, I dicussed was adding a feature to the picture of an iphone where some parts are hoverable and able to extract 
            information about the parts used in it by hovering and clicking on it. I was also encouraged to add the world tour using d3.js library.

            To achieve this goal, I would need to watch more tutorials about using GSAP to figre out some more creative ways to have cleaner and smoother
            way to transition sections in the page. To achieve the world tour js library, I would need to look into the code of each country and 
            examine how the examines were done.
