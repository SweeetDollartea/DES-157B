            <div id="text">hello, welcome to my page. This website talk about REE. The point of this website to have a scroll responsive 
                design where the user can scroll through to understand more information. This is a rough prototype of what my overall website
                would look like. I would like to know if the experience so far is easy or hard digest.
                <br>
                I am a planning to add more animations on specific texts using GSAP, but that is still a work in progress. 
                After the chart, I am planning to add more graphs, more images of what companies are contributing to the mining, and the future 
                state of how companies would operate without REE and the effort they are putting in.
                <br>
                Question:<br>
                Are some animations or scroll features confusing you?<br>
                What do you think could be improved in terms of design and the overal style?<br>
                What other features do you think could be implemented to make it more interactive?
